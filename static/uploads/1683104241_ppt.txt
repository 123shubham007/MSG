good morning sir i am shubham kumar with my team sud....sidd...utt.... to introduce our project meeting summary generator...

A meeting summary generator is a tool that automates the process of creating a summary of a meeting. it analyzes the meeting 
transcript or recording and identifies the key points, decisions, action items, and any other relevant information discussed during 
the meeting. It then generates a concise and organized summary that can be used to share the meeting outcomes with attendees or 
stakeholders who were not present at the meeting. The summary generator saves time and ensures that all important details are 
captured accurately, helping to facilitate effective communication and decision-making.

In many organizations, there are often lengthy and unproductive meetings that waste time and lead to confusion. Participants may 
have trouble recalling important details or action items from the meeting, which can cause delays in progress and decrease 
productivity. A summary meeting generator aims to solve this problem by automatically generating concise and accurate summaries 
of meetings that capture the main points and action items discussed. This tool would enable participants to quickly review the 
meeting highlights and take appropriate actions, leading to more efficient and effective decision-making processes. The challenge in 
developing such a tool lies in accurately capturing the essence of the meeting and distilling it into a coherent summary that is both 
informative and actionable.
